-----------

WordPress plugin to provide a slider of elements provided by a custom post type

Slider Design Requirements
---------------------------
- All elements will have a common width X
- Contol arrows can live either overtop, or outside of the scrolled element set
- Controls will scroll either one at a time or by the number of visible elements (if 4 are visible, rotate forward/back by 4)
- Option to scroll infinitely via a wrapping scroll
	- If scrolling by set, what happens when scrolling by set and the total elements is not evenly divisible by the set (14 total elements and a set is 4)
- Pluggable with a modal popup box
	- Additionally, controls on modal will scroll through elements within the slider collection one at a time
